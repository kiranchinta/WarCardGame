This app is created by following the course at Code with Chris. Link - http://codewithchris.com/how-to-make-an-iphone-app/

The app is a card game. When the deal button is clicked, the cards on the player and enemy changes. 
Who ever get the high card get's a point. If both the cards are same then it taken as a draw and no one get's a point. 
The app should work on any iOS device and both in portrait and landscape modes with  no issues.
